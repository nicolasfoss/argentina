# Planning public policy in Argentina

As statistics and machine learning methods become more pervasive, policymakers have also increased their use of these techniques when deciding how to allocate public resources. 

In this project, we will analyze economic and social development indicators for 22 provinces of Argentina to help plan an education program.

This project assumes we can manipulate data frames using dplyr, make plots using ggplot2, and understand principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering.

The data for this project was published by INDEC and includes indicators such as poverty, population, and GDP for each province.
